# The Visualisation of Nature-Inspired Algorithms
This is the application that I made with the work on my dissertation on Nature-Inspired Algorithms, and the visualisation of them. 

# Introduction
Nature-inspired algorithms is a large field of research that encapsulates a vast number of
different algorithms, that have been getting more popular because of their good
performances. The classic example of a nature-inspired algorithm is the Evolutionary
Algorithm, which is an optimisation algorithm that mimics the nature of biological evolution.
More recently, there has been development of an algorithms based on the propagation of
COVID-19 to simulate how the virus spreads. These are only two algorithms out of this
large sector of research, and I am sure there are going to be many more new nature-inspired
algorithms developed in the future. For me personally, I think that nature-inspired algorithms
as a topic of research is very interesting which was my main motivation for deciding to do this
project. There are so many different algorithms to learn about that there is bound to be some
that really interest you. For more information about these algorithms you can follow [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4186) and read the document.
